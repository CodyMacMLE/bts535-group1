### Problem
Hiking is a popular summer activity amongst the adventurest, nature-loving, exercise seeking community, yet many hikers struggle to discover new trails that match their skill level or interests. Current resources are limited to static trail maps and google map reviews, which does not give an insight into a personalized recommendation. Due to the lack of limited information, hikers may not find trails best suited to their preferences, difficulty levels, or finding that unique experience shared by a fellow hiker.

### Solution
Our web app aims to create a hiking application that allows our users to log their hikes, rate their experiences, and share their feedback to the community. By compiling these logs and ratings, the app will generate ranking recomendations for other users helping them find a trail suited to their skill level and preferences. The app will include but is not limited to categories like: location, distance, elevation, time, difficulty, trail types, conditions, hazards, wildlife, and crowd levels.

### Technologies
To implement our project, we will build a simple web appliction using React.js for a front-end interface, express.js for backend server logic and api, and Neon.tech a SQL database for data storage and retrieval. Together, these technologies will provide a responsive light-weight platform for hikers to log, rank, and explore trails.

1) Front-End: React.js
2) Back-End: Node.js & Express.js
3) Database: Neon.tech (SQL)
4) Auth: AWS Cognito
5) Version Control: Git/Github
